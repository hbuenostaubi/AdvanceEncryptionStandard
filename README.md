## Simple AES Simulation with Python

The python script shows the encryption and decryption process of a the [Advance Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) block cypher (also known as Rijndael) with a python script. As DES was depricated in 1999, AES was created as a replacement. The process for the cipher is much more complicated and contains a much larger key length and complicated block ciphers. Although similar in process, it is much more secure.
